-- mason.nvim is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily manage external editor tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters through a single interface. It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.), with only a small set of external requirements needed.
